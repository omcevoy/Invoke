# Invoke
A cold-calling system designed to be used in a classroom setting. This project was created for the CIS 422 Software
Methodology Class and in collaboration with James Kang, Samuel Lundquist, Mason Sayyadi, and Zach Woodworth. 


This system is designed to be used specifically on Mac OS 10.13 or 10.14, although it can also be used on Linux platforms. The UI requires that the user have either Xcode or the ncurses library installed. 

**For a comprehensive walkthrough on how to build and use the system, please refer to the Technical Documentation document.
